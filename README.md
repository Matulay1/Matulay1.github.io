## Matulay Personal Portfolio Website

**Features Implemented:**
- Scrollable photo sections with hidden scrollbars.
- Contact form with word limit with the help of js.
- Responsive buttons to change categories of each gallery.
- Change of colors when hovering.
- Animations for the navigation that ChatGpt suggested, eventually settling with the colored-side design after a few experimentations. 
- Contact form in the contacts page but still not usable send button.

**Deviations from the Wireframe:**
- The first noticeable change would be the pictures used.
Reason: I plan to use this site in the future as a personal website. To make it more aligned with my actual content and design preferences, I used my own photos for better visualization and to reflect a more realistic final version.
      : the images used are not final, it was just the best ones I had as of now.
- Second change would be the choice of colors used, such as the gradient color of the title and the design of the nav animations.
Reason: I wanted the colors to center more around shades of pink to better reflect not just my preferences but also the site's theme. I think it suits the logo better and helps it not look too out of place.
- The design black background color of the footer on the home page.
Reason: At first, the background color was supposed to be removed since the image already looked good without it, but I later decided to keep it to cover the lower part of the picture for a more appropriate look as a cover, only slightly changing the design, making it fade on the upper part instead of a sudden cut.
- The last change noticable would be the layout of the gallery in the projects page.
Reason: It was the best I could do after countless tries of trying to just fix the sizes, margines, gaps, and spaces in hopes of getting it to look like the wireframe. In the end, I settled with such alignment.
